Objective:
Your goal is to implement the Observer design pattern to create a simple weather monitoring system. This pattern is perfect for situations where a change in one object (the "subject") needs to be communicated to a list of other objects (the "observers") without the subject needing to know who or what those observers are.
Scenario: The Weather Station
Imagine you have a WeatherStation that measures temperature, humidity, and pressure. You also have various display devices that need to show this weather data.
● CurrentConditionsDisplay: Shows the most recent measurements.
● StatisticsDisplay: Shows the average temperature.
Whenever the WeatherStation gets new measurements, all connected display devices should update automatically.
